Implement the final score display using the following structure:

Display order in the final score modal:
1. Score: {score} / {totalPossiblePoints}
2. Accuracy: {accuracy}% accuracy
3. Feedback: {getFeedback(accuracy)}

Scoring details:
- Accuracy is calculated as (score / totalPossiblePoints) * 100
- Accuracy should be rounded to the nearest whole number

Feedback logic:
- If accuracy is 80% or higher → return "Strong"
- If accuracy is between 50% and 79% → return "Solid"
- If accuracy is below 50% → return "Needs practice"

Constraints:
- Feedback must be neutral and encouraging
- No emojis
- No animations

Technical requirements:
- Implement getFeedback as a simple helper function
- Keep logic readable and easy to adjust later
- Show the full updated code for the score display
- Explain only what changed
