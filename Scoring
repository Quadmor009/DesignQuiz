Add a scoring system to the Design Gym quiz.

Scoring rules:
- Each correct answer = 100 points
- No partial credit
- No negative scoring

Session rules:
- Beginner sessions have 5 questions (max 500 points)
- Mid-level sessions have 7 questions (max 700 points)

Behavior:
- Do not show score during the quiz
- Track score silently as the user progresses
- Show final score only after the last question

Score display:
- Show score as “X / total”
- Show accuracy percentage
- Keep the presentation calm and minimal
- No animations, confetti, or gamification

Optional:
- Add a simple qualitative feedback line based on accuracy
  (e.g. strong / solid / needs practice)

Technical requirements:
- Keep scoring logic simple and readable
- Use React state only
- Show full updated code for the main page component
- Explain only what changed and why
